	<h2>How to Play Reversi</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
		Reversi is played on an 8×8 board similar to that of chess. The two players each have 32 pieces, 
		which are white on one side and black on the other. The game begins with each player having two pieces placed
		diagonally in the center of the board.
		</li>
		<li>
		Black begins by placing a piece, black-side up, adjacent to a white piece and opposite another black piece, 
		so that a line of one or more white pieces directly intervenes (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) between
		the two black pieces. You can open with any legal move.
		</li>
		<li>
		When black places a piece so that an adjacent white piece is between two blacks, the white piece is 
		flipped over to black. Note that pieces may be flipped and change hands many times during a game.
		</li>
		<li>
		You may capture one or more pieces on a given turn. 
		Also, you may capture any number of your opponent’s pieces in one or more rows diagonally, 
		vertically and horizontally. Again, these pieces may change hands many times during a game.
		</li>
		<li>
		Black can capture two separate rows of white pieces in one move. 
		If you cannot make a legal move, you automatically surrender your turn to your opponent. 
		The winner is the player with the most pieces of his or her color on the board at the end of the game.
		</li>
